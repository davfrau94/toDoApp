<h1>To Do App</h1>
<p>A ToDo App is a task management app to help you stay organized and manage your day-to-day.</p>
<p>A to-do list is just a list of things you have to-do. 
  That means basically anything and everything can be on your to-do listâ€”but just because you've written your to-dos down doesn't mean your to-do list is actually useful. </p>
